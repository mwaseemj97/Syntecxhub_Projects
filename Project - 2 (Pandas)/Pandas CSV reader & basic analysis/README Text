# Project 2: Pandas CSV Reader & Basic Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform basic data analysis using **Python** and **pandas**. The main goal is to read CSV or Excel files into a pandas DataFrame, inspect the data, perform basic analysis, filter and slice subsets, and save the results for further use.

---

## Features
- Read CSV or Excel files into a pandas DataFrame.
- Inspect the data:
  - View first few rows (`head()`) and last few rows (`tail()`).
  - Check data types of columns.
- Compute summary statistics:
  - Mean, median, minimum, maximum, and count for numerical columns.
- Filter rows based on conditions.
- Select specific columns and slice subsets of data.
- Save filtered or processed data to CSV or Excel for later use.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

---

## Example Usage
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Inspect the data
print(df.head())
print(df.tail())
print(df.dtypes)

# Compute summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Filter rows and select columns
filtered_df = df.loc[df['Age'] > 25, ['Name', 'Age', 'City']]

# Save filtered results
filtered_df.to_csv('filtered_data.csv', index=False)
